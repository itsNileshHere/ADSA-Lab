## Problem

This program implements Huffman Coding, a popular lossless data compression algorithm. It reads an input text file, calculates character frequencies, constructs a Huffman tree, generates unique binary codes for each character, and then encodes the input file into a new file (`encoded.txt`).

## Theory

Huffman Coding is a greedy algorithm used for lossless data compression. The core idea is to assign variable-length codes to input characters based on their frequencies. Characters that appear more frequently are assigned shorter binary codes, while less frequent characters receive longer codes. This strategy minimizes the total length of the encoded data.

The algorithm consists of two main parts:

1.  **Building the Huffman Tree:**
    *   **Frequency Analysis:** First, the frequency of each character in the input data is determined.
    *   **Min-Priority Queue:** Each unique character is initially treated as a leaf node with its frequency as its priority. These nodes are inserted into a min-priority queue.
    *   **Tree Construction:** The algorithm repeatedly extracts the two nodes with the lowest frequencies from the priority queue. A new internal node is created with these two nodes as children, and its frequency is the sum of its children's frequencies. This new internal node is then inserted back into the priority queue. This process continues until only one node (the root of the Huffman tree) remains in the priority queue.
    *   The Huffman tree is a binary tree where leaf nodes represent the original characters, and internal nodes represent sums of frequencies.

2.  **Generating Huffman Codes:**
    *   Once the Huffman tree is built, the unique binary codes are generated by traversing the tree from the root to each leaf node. Typically, a '0' is assigned for a left branch and a '1' for a right branch. The path from the root to a leaf forms the Huffman code for that character.
    *   A crucial property of Huffman codes is that they are **prefix-free**, meaning no character's code is a prefix of another character's code, which prevents ambiguity during decoding.

## Approach

The `Huffman_Coding.c` program implements the Huffman algorithm using linked lists for tree nodes and an array-based min-heap for the priority queue.

-   **`MinHeapNode` struct:** Represents a node in the Huffman tree, storing the `data` (character), its `freq` (frequency), and pointers to `left` and `right` children.
-   **`MinHeap` struct:** Represents the min-priority queue, storing its `size`, `capacity`, and an array of `MinHeapNode` pointers.
-   **Helper Functions (e.g., `newNode`, `createMinHeap`, `swapMinHeapNode`, `minHeapify`, `extractMin`, `insertMinHeap`, `buildMinHeap`, `isSizeOne`):** These functions manage the creation and operations of the min-heap, crucial for building the Huffman tree efficiently.
-   **`createAndBuildMinHeap()`:** Initializes the min-heap with character nodes and their frequencies.
-   **`buildHuffmanTree()`:** This function implements the core tree construction logic: repeatedly extracting two minimum-frequency nodes, creating a new parent node, and inserting it back into the heap until only the root remains.
-   **`storeCodes()`:** This recursive function traverses the completed Huffman tree to assign and store the binary codes for each character.
-   **`calcFrequency()`:** Reads the input file character by character to calculate the frequency of each character.
-   **`HuffmanCodes()`:** The main Huffman encoding function:
    1.  Calls `calcFrequency()` to get character frequencies from the input `filename`.
    2.  Prepares `data` and `freqArr` arrays containing only characters with non-zero frequencies.
    3.  Calls `buildHuffmanTree()` to construct the Huffman tree.
    4.  Calls `storeCodes()` to generate and store the Huffman codes.
    5.  Prints the Huffman codes for each character.
    6.  Re-reads the input file and writes the encoded binary string (using the generated Huffman codes) to `encoded.txt`.
-   **`main()`:** Prompts the user for the input text filename and then calls `HuffmanCodes()` to perform the encoding.

## Usage

To compile and run the code:

```bash
gcc Huffman_Coding.c -o Huffman_Coding
./Huffman_Coding
```

The program expects an input text file (e.g., `input.txt`). After execution, it will create an `encoded.txt` file in the same directory containing the binary Huffman-encoded data.

Example `input.txt`:
```
hello world
```
